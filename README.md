- ⚡ Fun fact: The name "Docker" comes from the term dock worker—a nod to its role in "containerizing" applications. Just like dock workers efficiently load and unload shipping containers, Docker organizes, ships, and deploys your app's "containers" across systems. So every time you’re using Docker, you’re basically a modern-day digital dock worker! 🚢🐳
